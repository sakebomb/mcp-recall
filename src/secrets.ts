 * Patterns for detecting secrets in tool output content.

 * ReDoS audit (2026-09-11): no catastrophic backtracking. The AWS secret
 * pattern (.{0,20}…{0,20}) tops out at 400 backtracks. The OpenAI watermark arm
 * bounds both runs around a literal ({16,120}); measured linear in input length
 * — 52 KB of adversarial "sk-" starts with no marker takes 0.5 ms, 1 MB takes
 * 10 ms, with no superlinear knee. All other patterns use simple character
 * classes with no nested quantifiers.

    // Three arms, most-specific first. Read them together — each covers a shape
    // the others structurally cannot, and dropping any one fails open.
    //
    // The leading lookbehind is what fixed #274, NOT a narrower body class.
    // `[\w-]` matched any hyphenated slug containing "risk-"/"task-"/"disk-" —
    // 97% false positives on a real corpus — because in "ri|sk-" both neighbours
    // are word characters, so there is no boundary. Requiring one killed that
    // whole slug class. It did not, however, help where "sk-" is a *standalone*
    // token: "sk-project-notes-draft-…" and "sk-1042-add-retry-…" (a two-letter
    // Jira key) still matched a bare `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{20,}` body (#276).
    //
    // Arm 1 — the watermark. Every modern OpenAI key embeds `T3BlbkFJ`
    // (base64 "OpenAI") mid-body; gitleaks and Semgrep both key on it precisely
    // because it is specific enough to need no other constraint. This arm is
    // deliberately PREFIX-AGNOSTIC, which is what keeps arm 2's closed list from
    // being a false-negative trap: a future `sk-<newtype>-` key is still caught
    // here. The window is wider than gitleaks' {20,74} so an unknown prefix
    // cannot push the marker out of range; widening cannot add false positives
    // because the marker itself is doing the discriminating.
    //
    // Arm 2 — known prefixes, permissive body, no upper bound. Covers a modern
    // key whose marker is absent or sits beyond arm 1's window. The body must
    // STAY permissive: these carry base64url containing "-" and "_", so a
    // hyphen-free class would fail open on every current key shape — the
    // false-negative trap this pattern was briefly rewritten into.
    // DO NOT "simplify" this list away, and do not treat it as the only
    // prefix defence; it is the backstop for arm 1, not a whitelist.
    //
    // Arm 3 — legacy bare `sk-`: 32+ hyphen-free base62. Stopping at the first
    // hyphen is exactly what rejects the #276 slugs ("project", "1042").
    //
    // The two lookaheads are structurally redundant today (no arm can match
    // "sk-ant-"/"sk-or-v1-"), but they are kept so the "label the vendor
    // unambiguously" invariant survives anyone loosening arm 3's class.
